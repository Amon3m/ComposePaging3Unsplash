## Overview

This Android project showcases the implementation of the Paging 3 library along with Jetpack Compose for building a modern pagination UI. It demonstrates efficient loading and display of large datasets from the Unsplash API while caching them locally for optimal performance and offline access.

## Features

- Paging 3: Implements efficient data loading by fetching data in paginated chunks from a remote data source.
- Jetpack Compose for UI: Utilizes Jetpack Compose to create a responsive and dynamic pagination UI that seamlessly loads data as the user scrolls.
- Remote Data Source: Retrieves data from the Unsplash API using Retrofit and Moshi for efficient network communication.
- Local Database: Stores cached data locally using Room Persistence Library, ensuring fast access and offline functionality.
- Dependency Injection with Hilt: Implements Hilt for dependency injection, simplifying object creation and scoping.
- ViewModel Architecture: Utilizes ViewModel to manage UI-related data, ensuring data persistence across configuration changes.
- Coroutines for Asynchronous Programming: Employs Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous tasks, ensuring smooth and responsive UI interactions.


# Remote Mediator 


As an implementation of the RemoteMediator interface provided by Paging 3, it facilitates the seamless integration of remote data sources with the local database.

## Responsibilities
- Fetching Remote Data: The UnsplashRemoteMediator class fetches paged data from the Unsplash API, coordinating with the API to request data in manageable chunks.

- Storing Data Locally: Fetched data is stored locally in the database using Room Persistence Library, enabling faster access and offline functionality.

- Pagination Logic: The class encapsulates pagination logic, determining when to load additional pages of data based on user interactions such as scrolling.

- Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms ensure the stability and responsiveness of the application, even in challenging network conditions.
